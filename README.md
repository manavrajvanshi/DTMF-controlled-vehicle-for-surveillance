# DTMF-controlled-vehicle-for-surveillance

Connect the DTMF Module to the Arduino and update the connection pins in the code (A, B, C, D).
Use the Motor Driver Board (L293D) in ACTIVE LOW state.
If the vehicle moves in the opposite directions from what is specified in the code, then -
  1) Either Swap the motor connections
  2) Else debug using the console monitor (Convert the bit shifted binary to int and change the connections accordingly).
